## Abstract
This study introduces a novel method for generating adjacency and distance matrices from regional boundary data, specifically applied to Thailand’s 77 provinces and 928 districts. In alignment with emerging needs for robust data in sustainable transport systems, we developed a geospatial dataset that leverages these matrices to enhance urban and transportation planning. This dataset enables detailed spatial analysis, crucial for optimizing transport networks and advancing sustainable city development through strategic initiatives. By facilitating the integration, processing, and visualization of large-scale transport data, our approach addresses key challenges in managing and analyzing high-dimensional geospatial information. We demonstrate practical applications of this dataset in urban planning, including community detection and centrality measurement, which are pivotal in assessing transport equity, accessibility, and resilience in response to dynamic urban challenges. This research contributes to the advancement of geospatial data applications in transport systems, providing policymakers and planners with essential tools to foster more connected and sustainable urban environments, thereby supporting global sustainability goals.
