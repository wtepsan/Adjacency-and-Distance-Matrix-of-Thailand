## Abstract

Our study introduces the concept of product growth poles, pioneering a framework to stimulate regional growth through agricultural products. By merging transportation and production data with graph centralities and comparative analysis, we advance economic geographic analysis tools, enabling the identification of potential growth poles for specific products. We validate this methodology through a case study on Thailand's longan industry, highlighting economic potentials and offering insights for agricultural economics and regional development. This cross-disciplinary approach enhances understanding of key transportation and economic network nodes, providing policymakers with data-driven strategies for infrastructure investment. Our findings advocate for utilizing product growth poles as catalysts for national economic strategies, marking a new direction for regional development through targeted agricultural production.
